# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will leave (churn) a business using machine learning. The goal is to help companies identify at-risk customers early and improve retention strategies.  

## 📊 Dataset
- Contains customer information and historical behavior data  
- Features include demographics, account info, service usage, and customer support interactions  
- Target variable: churn (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy for data handling  
- Scikit-learn for modeling  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization  

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering and selection  
4. Model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting  
5. Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC  
6. Hyperparameter tuning for optimization  

## 📈 Results
- Best model:  Random forest classifier 
- Accuracy: 92%  

## 💻 How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git

cd customer-churn-prediction

pip install -r requirements.txt

jupyter notebook CustomerChurnPrediction.ipynb
```
# 🌟 Future Work
Deploy model as API for real-time churn prediction

Use deep learning models for improved accuracy

Incorporate more customer behavioral data
